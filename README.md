# Cat localization with CNN

Hi, I wrote this for the guide.

- Create folder name "model"
- There is a file name "data_generation.py", run it for generating sample data
- Go to "build_model.py", scroll down to line 109, you can choose between "model_v1" and "model_v2" to train and save
  + model_v1 is simple CNN (I think?) and regression layers
  + model_v2 is VGG architecture and regression layers
- At the end, you can press 'q' to exit the window that name 'pred'
- Go to file 'test_img.py', in line 17, you write the trained model in 'model' folder and run

Thank you for visit :3
